                    <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
                    <p>An increasing number of companies see the potential of AI at the 'edge' of the network, i.e., performing local data processing to enable real-time decisions without relying on the cloud. At the same time, modern deep-learning models are growing larger at a rapid pace, making it challenging to deploy them on edge devices with limited computing power and memory.</p>
                    <p>On top of that, companies often struggle with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specializing (transfer learning) and sufficiently "compressing" large pre-trained AI models so they can run both quickly and accurately on edge platforms.</li>
                        <li>Choosing the best combination of edge hardware and software for their specific needs.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring deployed AI models in operation, so they can quickly detect and address declines in performance or accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h2>PROJECT GOALS</h2>
                    <p>Within the <strong>MEDLI</strong> project (<strong>M</strong>aking <strong>E</strong>dge <strong>AI</strong> <strong>D</strong>eployment <strong>L</strong>ight and <strong>I</strong>mpactful), we tackle these challenges and provide practical, industry-ready solutions. We consolidate state-of-the-art knowledge into a user-friendly approach that allows companies to:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Accelerate edge AI model development</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leverage pre-trained deep learning models and transfer-learning techniques.</li>
                        <li>Compress these models (e.g., pruning, quantization) to reduce their size while maintaining sufficient accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. Easily select the right hardware and software</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An overview of relevant edge hardware (GPU, TPU, CPU, etc.) and corresponding compilers & deployment tools.</li>
                        <li>Practical guidelines and decision trees: which solution best fits your application requirements?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Monitor AI models in operation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Best practices and tool overviews to keep tabs on a model's health (accuracy, errors, drift).</li>
                        <li>Automatic detection of performance drops, with triggers for re-training or other adjustments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Generic use cases and demonstrations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A sample use case on image processing (e.g. vision systems for quality inspection).</li>
                        <li>A sample use case on time-series data (e.g. vibration, sensor, or audio signals).</li>
                        <li>Both are fully worked out with step-by-step documentation, serving as a blueprint for companies.</li>

                    <h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We collect and translate existing research outcomes on model compression, edge-hardware prototyping, and AI monitoring.</li>
                        <li>We develop an intuitive graphical interface that lets you adapt and optimize pre-trained models using your own (limited) dataset.</li>
                        <li>We provide guides, workshops, and webinars to get your R&D team up to speed.</li>
                        <li>We offer follow-up activities for companies interested in taking the MEDLI approach further in their own applications.</li>
