            <p className="text-lg">
              An increasing number of companies see the potential of AI at the 'edge' of the network, i.e., performing local data processing to enable real-time decisions without relying on the cloud. At the same time, modern deep-learning models are growing larger at a rapid pace, making it challenging to deploy them on edge devices with limited computing power and memory.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">On top of that, companies often struggle with:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Specializing (transfer learning) and sufficiently "compressing" large pre-trained AI models so they can run both quickly and accurately on edge platforms.</li>
              <li>Choosing the best combination of edge hardware and software for their specific needs.</li>
              <li>Monitoring deployed AI models in operation, so they can quickly detect and address declines in performance or accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
